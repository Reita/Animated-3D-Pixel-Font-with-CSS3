/--- About ---/
This little experiment is basically a modificaction of Peter Magenheimer's
Animated Pixel Font with CSS3 that includes CSS3 3D transforms.

Just like Peter's experiment this is pretty much pure HTML5 and CSS3, with
only minor touches of jQuery to add keyboard support and to fix certain bugs
that arose during the creation of the experiment.

This is a first release; I'm quite aware my 3d cubes can be simplified and
the experiment could probably use 3D translations only in order to work on
Firefox/Opera. I have included every single side of the cube however in my
demo only 3 are being actively used.

/--- Known Issues ---/
For some weird and unknown reason whenever you tab between anchors (or use
tabindex in order to set active/focused states) Chrome seems to butcher the
animation and you start getting choppy/laggy animation movements so I decided
to omit tabindex and use some good 'ole jQuery. The choppy movement can still
be replicated if you tab though.

I didn't care about supporting other browsers; however propietary vendor 
prefixes are already in place.

Doesn't seem to work on Chrome under Ubuntu 11.04; at least not with my setup.

Animation is way better on Safari compared to Chrome.
